├── src/                # Core source files for the application
├── test.obj            # A test object file (possibly for 3D model data)
├── utils.py            # Utility functions for various tasks
├── __init__.py         # Marks this directory as a Python module
└── __pycache__/        # Compiled Python bytecode
```

## Key Files and Directories

### Main Scripts
- **`demo.py`**
  - Entry point for processing images
  - Integrates preprocessing, pose estimation, and measurement extraction

- **`inference.py`**
  - Performs pose estimation to identify key body landmarks

- **`extract_measurements.py`**
  - Computes human body measurements based on detected landmarks

- **`utils.py`**
  - Contains helper functions for preprocessing, calculations, and optimizations

### Supporting Directories
- **`bin/`**
  - May contain executable files or scripts related to the project

- **`data/`**
  - Holds raw input data or preprocessed datasets

- **`deeplab_model/`**
  - Directory for deep learning models used in preprocessing or segmentation

- **`examples/`**
  - Contains example inputs and outputs for testing or demonstration purposes

- **`models/`**
